    "sceene": "A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.#A CLOCK reads twenty to six.#A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno, Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his back to the camera, phone in hand.#THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.#A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.#THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair and stands.#THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face.

DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him.#The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.#Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE approach.

DANTE leaps at his feet, and RANDAL grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTE'S face. DANTE paws at his eyes.

I never noticed it untiltoday.# What's that?# All right, Vader's boss...# The Emperor.# Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperoris kind of a spiritual figure, yes?# How do you mean?# Well, he's like the pope for thedark side of the Force. He's a holyman; a shaman, kind of, albeit anevil one.# I guess.# Now, he's in charge of the Empire.The Imperial government is underhis control. And the entire galaxyis under Imperial rule.# Yeah.# Then wouldn't that logically meanthat it's a theocracy? If the headof the Empire is a priest of somesort, then it stands to reason thatthe government is therefore onebased on religion.# It would stand to reason, yes.# Hence, the Empire was a fascisttheocracy, and the rebel forceswere therefore battling religiouspersecution.# More or less.# The only problem is that at nopoint in the series did I ever hearLeia or any of the rebels declare aparticular religious belief.# I think they were Catholics.# Are you open?# Yeah.

They were stillunder construction.# So?# A construction job of that magnitudewould require a helluva lot moremanpower than the Imperial army hadto offer. I'll bet there wereindependent contractors working onthat thing: plumbers, aluminumsiders, roofers.# Not just Imperials, is what you'regetting at.# Exactly. In order to get it builtquickly and quietly they'd hireanybody who could do the job.

This is a lifeof convenience for you, and anyattempt to change it would shatterthe pathetic microcosm you'vefashioned for yourself.# Oh, like your life's any better?# I'm satisfied with my situation fornow. You don't hear me bitching.You, on the other hand, have beenbitching all day.# Thank you. Why don't you go back tothe video store?# It's the same thing with Veronica.# Leave her out of this.# You date Veronica because she's lowmaintenance and because it'sconvenient. Meanwhile, all you everdo is talk about Caitlin. You carrya torch for a girl you dated inhigh school-in high school forGod's sake! You're twenty-two!# Leave me alone.# If you want Caitlin, then faceVeronica, tell her, and be withCaitlin. If you want Veronica, bewith Veronica. But don't pine forone and fuck the other. Man, if youweren't such a fucking coward...# ...If I wasn't such a fuckingcoward.(chuckles)It must be so great to be able tosimplify everything the way you do.# Am I right or what?# You're wrong. Things happenedtoday, okay? Things that probablyruined my chances with Caitlin.# What? The dead guy? She'll get overfucking the dead guy. Shit, mymom's been fucking a dead guy forthirty years; I call him Dad.# Caitlin and I can't be together.It's impossible.# Melodrama coming from you seemsabout as natural as an oral bowelmovement.# What do you want me to say? Yes, Isuppose some of the things you'resaying may be true. But that's theway things are; it's not going tochange.# Make them change.# I can't, all right! Jesus, wouldyou leave me alone? I can't makechanges like that in my life. If Icould, I would-but I don't have theability to risk comfortablesituations on the big money and thefabulous prizes.# Who're you kidding? You can so.# Jesus H. Christ, I can't!# So you'll continue being miserableall the time, just because youdon't have the guts to face change?# Lovely story.# Point is-I'm not the kind of personthat disrupts things in order toshit comfortably.# Done poisoning the youth for the day?# Hell yes, whatever that means. NowI'm gonna head over to Atlantic,drink some beers, get ripped, and-please God-get laid.(pulls out money)E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.# One seventy-nine.# A half hour.# We get off about the same timeevery night. We should hang out.You get high?# I should start.# Wanna come to this party tonight?There's gonna be some pussy there,man!# With you? I don't think so.# Listen to you. Oh shit. \"Oh, Idon't hang out with drug dealers.\"# Nothing personal.# I work, just like you. You're moreof a crook than I am, dude.# How do you figure...HEY! You can'troll a joint in here!# It's not my store.# And these aren't my drugs-I justsell them.# The difference is you exploit aweakness.# What's that mean?# You sell to people that can't stayaway from an addiction.# All right. How much is Pepsi here?# A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.# At Food City it's ninety-ninecents, plus tax.# So.# So why do you sell it for so muchmore? I'll tell you why-becausepeople come here and they're like\"A dollar eighty for soda? I shouldget it at Food City. But I don'tfeel like driving there. I'll justbuy it here so I don't have todrive up there.\" That's exploitinga weakness, too, isn't it?# I can't believe you just rolled ajoint in here.# Hey, man, what happened with thatold guy?# He died in the bathroom.# That's fucked up. Yo, I heard hewas jerkin' off.# I don't know. I wasn't watching.# Probably saw that Caitlin chick. Iknow I felt like beatin' it when Isaw her.(pantomimes sex)Come here, bitch! You like this? Isthis what you want? Hunhh?# Knock it off. That used to be mygirlfriend.# You used to go out with her?# We were going to start again, Ithink.# Don't you already have a girlfriend?# Veronica.# Is she that girl who's down hereall the time? She came here todaycarrying a plate of food.# Lasagne.# And what-you were gonna dump her todate that Caitlin chick?# Maybe.# I don't know dude. That Caitlinchick's nice. But I see thatVeronica girl doing shit for youall the time. She brings you food,she rubs your back...Didn't I seeher change your tire one day?# I jacked the car up. All she didwas loosen the nuts and put thetire on.# Damn. She sure goes out of her way.# She's my girlfriend.# I've had girlfriends, but all theywanted from me was weed and shit.(beat)Shit, my grandma used to say,\"Which is better: a good plate withnothing on it...\" No, wait. Ifucked up. She said \"What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?\"# Meaning?# I don't know. She was senile andshit. Used to piss herself all thetime. C'mon Silent Bob.# You know, there's a million fine-looking women in the world, butthey don't all bring you lasagne atwork. Most of them just cheat on you.# So that's it. He doesn't love youanymore. He loves Caitlin.# And...he told you all of this?# Pretty much. All except the latenthomosexuality part-that's just mytheory.# I...I don't know what to say.# Don't hold it against him. He justnever got Caitlin out of his system.It's not your fault. It's Dante.(beat)I don't know thing one about chicks.Do you want to cry or something? Ican leave.# I'm not sad.# You're not?# No, I'm more furious. I'm pissedoff. I feel like he's been killingtime while he tries to grow theballs to tell me how he reallyfeels, and then he can't even do it!He has his friend do it for him!# He didn't ask me to...# After all that I've done for thatfuck! And he wants to be with thatslut? Fine! He can have his slut!# Um, do you think you can give me alift home tonight?# Wait! Veronica...I don't think...# What the fuck did you do that for?# If you didn't want to go out withme anymore, why didn't you just sayit? Instead, you pussyfoot aroundand see that slut behind my back!# What're you talking about?# It was only a few times...# And then you pull that shit thismorning, freaking out because I'vegone down on a couple guys!# A couple...?# Would you let me explain...# Explain what? How you were waitinguntil the time was right, and thenyou were going to dump me for her?# You're damn right it's not likethat! Because I won't let it belike that! You want your slut? Fine!The slut is yours!# I don't want Caitlin...# You don't know what you want, butI'm not going to sit here anymoreholding your hand until you figureit out! I've encouraged you to getout of this fucking dump and goback to school, to take charge ofyour life and find direction. Ieven transferred so maybe you wouldbe more inclined to go back tocollege if I was with you. Everyonesaid it was a stupid move, but Ididn't care because I loved you andwanted to see you pull yourself outof this senseless funk you've beenin since that whore dumped you, ohso many years ago. And now you wantto go back to her so she can fuckyou over some more?# I don't want to go back with her...# Of course not; not now! You'recaught, and now you're trying tosnake out of doing what you wantedto do. Well, I won't let you. Iwant you to follow through on this,just so you can find out what afucking idiot you are. And when shedumps you again-and she will,Dante, I promise you that-when shedumps you again, I want to laugh atyou, right in your face, just soyou realize that that was what yougave up our relationship for!(grabs her purse)I'm just glad Randal had the ballsto tell me, since you couldn't.# And having him tell me...that wasjust the weakest move ever. You'respineless.# Veronica, I love you...# Fuck you.# Dante?# How's your eye?# It's hard to swallow.# You didn't have to choke me.# Why the fuck did you tell Veronicathat I was going to dump her forCaitlin?# I thought I was doing you a favor.# Thanks.# You were saying how you couldn'tinitiate change yourself, so Ifigured I'd help you out.# Jesus.# You still didn't have to choke me.# Oh please! I'm surprised I didn'tkill you.# Why do you say that?# Why do I say that? Randal...forgetit.# No, really. What did I do that wasso wrong?# What don't you do? Randal, sometimesit seems like the only reason youcome to work is to make my lifemiserable.# How do you figure?# What time did you get to work today?# Like ten after.# You were over half an hour late.Then all you do is come over here.# To talk to you.# Which means the video store isostensibly closed.# It's not like I'm miles away.# Unless you're out renting videos atother video stores.# Hermaphrodites! I rented it so wecould watch it together!# You get my slapped with a fine, youfight with the customers and I haveto patch everything up. You get uschased out of a funeral by violatinga corpse. To top it all off, youruin my relationship. What's yourencore? Do you anally rape mymother while pouring sugar in mygas tank?# I threw out the stuff that gotbroken. The floor looks clean.# You need a ride?# Do you work tomorrow?# Same time. What about you?# I'm calling out. Going to hit thehospital-see how Caitlin is.
